The main goal of this [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/) is to take care of several boilerplate pain points that get in the way of starting a new project, while still being flexible enough to be used as a starting point for a website, blog, or progressive web app.

This starter supports Markdown for pages and content. This remains an optional feature of the starter. Feel free to add new pages the good old Gatsby way!

Other features include TypeScript support, site settings, SEO and smart page slugs, private pages and content partials, blog features, redirects, PWA support, syntax highlighting, Google Analytics, and more!

[See the official README for more &raquo;](https://github.com/justinmahar/gatsby-launchpad)

You can also have a look at the <gatsby-link to="/markdown-kitchen-sink">Markdown Kitchen Sink</gatsby-link> or an <gatsby-link to="/example-post">Example Post</gatsby-link>.
